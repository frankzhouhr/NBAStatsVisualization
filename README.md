# NBAStatsVisualization
• Created a dashboard using React, D3 and Ant Design backed by data crawled from stats.nba.com that allows users to visualize individual player’s shot data, including a shot chart and the player profile view
• Created extra filters and shot chart themes (hexbin and scatter) to provide more customized visualization 
•	Developed an autocomplete player search bar providing a list of players with their profile images and names
